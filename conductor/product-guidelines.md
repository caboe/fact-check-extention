# Product Guidelines

## 1. Brand Messaging & Voice

### 1.1. Tone of Voice

The extension should communicate with users in a **friendly and conversational** tone. The language used in the UI, notifications, and any other user-facing text should be approachable, encouraging, and easy to understand. Avoid overly technical jargon.

### 1.2. Persona

The extension's persona is that of a helpful assistant. It's a reliable tool that empowers users to find the truth, but it does so in a supportive, not an authoritative, way.

## 2. Visual Identity

### 2.1. Design Principles

The visual design should be **minimalist and clean**. The interface should feel modern, intuitive, and unobtrusive, ensuring that the focus remains on the content being checked, not the UI itself. This aligns with the existing use of the Skeleton UI toolkit.

### 2.2. Color Palette

The color palette should be simple and accessible. Use a primary color for interactive elements, a neutral color for text, and appropriate colors for success, error, and warning states. The design should be compatible with both light and dark modes.

### 2.3. Typography

Typography should be clean and legible. Use a standard sans-serif font that is easy to read at various sizes.
