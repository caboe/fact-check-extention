Fact Spreader

Are you tired of wading through questionable claims while browsing? The Fact Spreader Chrome Extension is your ultimate companion for cutting through the noise. With a simple highlight and click, you can send any piece of text on a webpage to your choice of advanced language models (LLMs)—including public services like ChatGPT or local models such as Ollama—to receive diverse fact-checking insights in real time.

Important Note: The extension itself does not perform fact-checking. Instead, it provides a streamlined workflow that lets you easily submit text to your configured AI endpoints, which then provide the analysis or verification.

Key Features:

Instant Fact-Checking: Highlight any text on a webpage, and with a click, transmit it to powerful models—online or locally hosted—to get clarity on the claim.
Flexible Model Support: Seamlessly switch between online models for convenience or offline local models for enhanced privacy and security.
Customizable Roles: Define the persona of your fact-checker (e.g., Scientist, Acerbic Rationalist) to tailor the tone and perspective of the analysis.
Context & Precision: Add custom context to your queries and control the response length with a word count slider for precise results.
Comprehensive Insights: Compare responses from different LLMs side by side, offering multiple perspectives and deeper verification.
User-Friendly Interface: Enjoy a clean, intuitive design that makes navigation simple and results easy to understand.
Privacy First: Keep sensitive data under your control when using local models without compromising performance.

Transform the way you consume information online with Fact Spreader — your personal workflow assistant for truth verification. Always remember to use reputable and trusted sources when verifying the accuracy of what you read.
